# Challenge: Currency Converter

## Description

This challenge was carried out during my participation in the "Java and Object Orientation T6 - ONE" course aimed at 
participants in the ONE Program held in a partnership between [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br) and [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/br/education/oracle-next-education/).

It consisted of developing a program that consumes the [API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com)  and generates a standard CLI to 
provide currency conversion options to the user.
